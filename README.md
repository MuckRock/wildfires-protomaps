# wildfires-protomaps

Let's build a self-hosted version of [this wildfire map](https://felt.com/map/Wildfires-are-becoming-more-frequent-across-the-West-QBFznerjRpK6BWnGzY9BRYC) using Protomaps and Svelte.

Svelte is really just here for UI elements like a legend. This could pretty easily be vanilla javascript.
